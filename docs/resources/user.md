# insightcloudsec_user (Resource)

Provides details on an user configuration for InsightCloudSec.  Functionality is currently limited to minimal aspects.

## Example Usage
```terraform
resource "insightcloudsec_user" "user_1" {
    name                    = "The Dougster"
    email_address           = "dougy@tester.com"
    username                = "dougy"
    access_level            = "BASIC_USER"
    console_access_denied   = false
}

resource "insightcloudsec_user" "user_2" {
    name          = "Admin Account"
    email_address = "centauri@alpha.com"
    username      = "alpha123"
    access_level  = "DOMAIN_ADMIN"
}
```

Temporary credentials can be emailed to users upon creation if you have configured the InsightCloudSec environment to do so.  If you need to retrieve a temporary password upon creation, you can by creating an output and sending it to raw or wrapping the value in the `nonsensitive` function.  This is not, however, advised.  A better option may be to output it to a solution such as Vault if you cannot configure a temporary link to be sent to the user upon creation.
